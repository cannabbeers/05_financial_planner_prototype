## Module 5 Challenge - Financial Planning with APIs and Simulations

### User Story

`UCB Fintech Credit Union, NPO` that focuses on projects to benefit local communities is developing a prototype financial checkup tool so their members are able to perform two basic tasks and sent to CTO for initial feedback for further improvements and enhancements.

To make this all safe, we begin by adding a link to the 'legal disclaimer' that should stop anyone reading here from acting on the advice as this is truly for educational and novelty purposes: 

        + <p style="text-align:center">WARNING !! Before proceeding, read our <font color="red"><ins>*[LEGAL DISCLAIMER](Images/legal_disclaimer.png)* </ins><--- CLICK HERE NOW !! WARNING 

                                                         
*Main features of prototype requested by CTO* 

1) Assess monthly budget - we are given a monthly income and that has been equated to an alias *AMS* for 'Average Monthly Salary'. 
2) Simulate and forecast a reasonably effective retirement plan based on their current holdings, we visualize and run some scenarios.
3) A financial planner for emergencies includes multiple ways to check prices for holdings in 'markdown' code 
4) A financial planner for retirement shows 2 main scenarios that could be modified and expanded after feedback from CTO received.
